# Assignments CS131: Computer Vision Foundations and Applications (self study)

## Overview
- This repository contains solutions of released assignments for the fall 2021 course of CS131 Standford course. 

## Content:
- **HW0**: go through basic linear algebra, NumPy, and image manipulation
- **HW1**: covers linear filters, convolution and correlation.
    - Takeaways 
        - *Cross-correlation* can be used for template matching: a template  𝑔  is multiplied with regions of a larger image  𝑓  to measure how similar each region is to the template. 
        - The running time of *a separable 2D convolution* is slower than its equivalent two 1D convolutions.
